  summary: `I’m Lindsay, an Ohio State University graduate with a passion for marketing and entrepreneurship. I have worked at a startup, a multi-billion dollar corporation, and studied everything in between. My experience spans across a wide range of products and services, so I specialize in jumping in with both feet and getting up to speed quickly. I love a challenge and thrive in a dynamic work environment where I get to wear many hats.
  
I have experience in social media, digital marketing, and data analysis. I managed all social media channels at a beverage startup called Life Support. With a focus on growth, I developed and implemented a strategy, created content, and engaged with customers. I have also worked at American Greetings, where I focused on analyzing customer data and past sales metrics to identify opportunities to improve productivity and create future retail strategies.
  
When I’m not working I’m probably on the beach volleyball court, whipping up something in the kitchen, or boarding a plane for my next adventure.`,
