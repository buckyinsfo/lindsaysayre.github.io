  summary: `I’m a digital marketing specialist and small business owner based in San Diego.
  
In 2017 I started an Amazon Ecommerce home and party goods company. I continue to run that business from A to Z on a day-to-day basis. I also consult with other businesses to help them start or grow their brands and improve their marketing strategy and content mix.
  
Before that, I worked at a beverage startup called Life Support, American Greetings, a multi-billion dollar greeting card company, and studied everything in between at Ohio State University.

When I’m not working I’m probably on the beach volleyball court, whipping up something in the kitchen, or boarding a plane for my next adventure.`,
